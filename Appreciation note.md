## **My Appreciation Note to The Data Scientist's Toolbox Course Instructors**

I am Joseph Ifeanyichukwu Okonkwo, a dental technology graduate of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Nigeria. I am a computer science enthusiast and I love coding. I took this course 'The Data Scientist's Toolbox' which is one of the courses in the data science specialization because of my desire to upgrade myself and be very good at data science. I want to be able to apply this skill in the healthcare sector and improve the quality of healthcare delivery in Nigeria.

I have learnt a lot from this course, from setting up R to downloading and setting up RStudio. I was able to learn Git and Github and was able to create repositories on github. The course has exposed me to using command line in Git bash to stage, commit and push files to github repositories from my local repository.

I appreciate the way the course was delivered and how the course is set up. I love the fact that the course is practical oriented and has quizzes that encourage critical thinking and further reading.

Thank you very much for impacting such wonderful knowledge on me. I love you all.
